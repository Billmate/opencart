Documentation with instructions on how to setup the plugin can be found at https://efinance.se/plugins/opencart/Instruktionsmanual_Opencart_Billmate_Plugin.pdf


== DESCRIPTION ==

Billmate Gateway is a plugin that extends OpenCart, allowing your customers to get their products first and pay by invoice to Billmate later (http://www.billmate.se) This plugin utilizes Billmate Invoice, Billmate Bank, Billmate Card and Billmate Part Payment (Standard Integration type).

When the order is passed to Billmate for Invoice and part payment, a credit record of the customer is made. If the check turns out all right, Billmate creates an invoice in billmateonline. After you (as the merchant) completes the order in OpenCart, you need to log in to Billmateonline.se to approve/send the invoice.

Billmate is a great payment alternative for merchants and customers in Sweden.


== IMPORTANT NOTE ==

This plugin does not currently support Campaigns or Mobile payments.

The plugin only works if the currency is set to Swedish Krona and the Base country is set to Sweden.
